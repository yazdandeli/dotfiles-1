# dotfiles
Dotfiles so i don't have to configure stuff each time =P

Shortened url link:
https://git.io/bruhfiles

---

I don't accept any feature request here, this repository is intended for my personal configuration storage

Note that dotfiles can be completely changed anytime depending on my customization and git history of previous dotfiles configs will be removed

Also if you found any bugs or errors when trying out my configuration files, you just need to wait until it got fixed

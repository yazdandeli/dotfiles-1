# dotfiles
Dotfiles so i don't have to configure stuff each time =P

Shortened url link:
https://git.io/bruhfiles

I don't accept any feature request here, this repository is intended for my personal configuration storage \
Also, dotfiles can be completely changed anytime depending on my customization and git history of previous dotfiles configs will be removed
